* A project based on biometric facial attendance involves using facial recognition technology to track and record attendance in various organizations such as workplaces, schools, or events. 
* This project includes facial detection, facial recognition, attendance, tracking, using Convolution Neural Networks. 
* The main aim is to automate and enhance the accuracy and efficient of attendance tracking while providing a convenient solution for organizations.

## Installation

* Requires Python 3.8 or 3.9 and above, I am using Python 3.9.13.

* Prepare a vertual environment in Python to isolate the project requirements from other projects in the system.

* To create vertual environment in python - open terminal in vscode and type the following.
```bash
  python -m venv newproject
```
* To activate the vertual environment to install the libraries inside our environment, type as follows inside the terminal of vscode.
For windows
```bash
  newproject\Scripts\Activate
```

Install opencv-python==4.10.0.84, numpy==1.26.4, face-recognition==1.3.0 libraries with pip
```bash
  pip install opencv-python==4.10.0.84 numpy==1.26.4 face-recognition==1.3.0
```
### *Note - using vertual environment prevents from version conflicts and dependency issues.*
## Deployment

To deploy this project run main.py file

```bash
  project_file_location_directory\python main.py
```
### *Note- Make sure that you have added your visual data into the "AttendancePics" Folder. Else the program doesn't matches any of the faces.*
